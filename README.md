# PyScraper

Trying to create a working scraper for certain websites outputing cheapest prices for certain items. Plans for Mimovrste and Mindfactory. Scripts are meant to go in crontab to run daily/weekly and dump prices into a local database using MySQL from which we can later fetch results or even create a PHP website showing these prices in some form or another.
